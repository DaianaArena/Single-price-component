# Single price component challenge

## About the project:

This project is a solution to the Single price component [Challenge by Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?types=free)

I approached this challenge by using HTML and CSS to create a clean and modern pricing component that is fully responsive and easy to use. The design is based on a grid layout, with clear and concise pricing information and calls to action.

Working on this project allowed me to further develop my frontend development skills, including layout design and responsive web design. It was also a chance to explore new design ideas and experiment with different techniques.

Overall, I'm proud of the final result and I believe it's a solid solution to the Single Price Grid Component Challenge. I hope it can inspire other frontend developers to push their skills to the next level and create beautiful and functional user interfaces.
